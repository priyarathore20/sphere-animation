# 3D Sphere Animation ðŸš€âœ¨

Welcome to my 3D sphere-animation App! ðŸŽ‰

This project is a journey from "npx create-react-app" to a fully interactive 3D sphere with particles that move, spin, and vibe like they're at a party. The magic happens with React, @react-three/fiber, and GSAP.

Itâ€™s been a wild ride, full of late-night coding sessions, some tears ðŸ˜…, and a lot of Googling. But seeing those particles spin on the screen made it all worth it. ðŸ™Œ

## Features
1. 3D Interactive Sphere: Watch the particles move and spin in 3D space.

2. Smooth Animations: Thanks to GSAP, the particles scale, spin, and respond to mouse movements.

3. Live Deployment: You can check it out in action! ðŸš€

## Tech Stack
1. React: For building the UI and managing state.

2. @react-three/fiber: The 3D magic behind the canvas and particles.

3. GSAP: Smooth animations to bring the particles to life.

4. Three.js: For the 3D geometry of the particles.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js & npm: Install from Node.js.

2. React Basics: A little knowledge of React, useState, useEffect, and useRef goes a long way.

3. Three.js & @react-three/fiber: For all things 3D.

4. GSAP: For animating those particles like a pro.
